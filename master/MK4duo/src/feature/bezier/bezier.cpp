  /**
   * The algorithm for computing the step is loosely based on the one in Kig
   * (See https://sources.debian.net/src/kig/4:15.08.3-1/misc/kigpainter.cpp/#L759)
   * However, we do not use the stack.
   *
   * The algorithm goes as it follows: the parameters t runs from 0.0 to
   * 1.0 describing the curve, which is evaluated by eval_bezier(). At
   * each iteration we have to choose a step, i.e., the increment of the
   * t variable. By default the step of the previous iteration is taken,
   * and then it is enlarged or reduced depending on how straight the
   * curve locally is. The step is always clamped between MIN_STEP/2 and
   * 2*MAX_STEP. MAX_STEP is taken at the first iteration.
   *
   * For some t, the step value is considered acceptable if the curve in
   * the interval [t, t+step] is sufficiently straight, i.e.,
   * sufficiently close to linear interpolation. In practice the
   * following test is performed: the distance between eval_bezier(...,
   * t+step/2) is evaluated and compared with 0.5*(eval_bezier(...,
   * t)+eval_bezier(..., t+step)). If it is smaller than SIGMA, then the
   * step value is considered acceptable, otherwise it is not. The code
   * seeks to find the larger step value which is considered acceptable.
   *
   * At every iteration the recorded step value is considered and then
   * iteratively halved until it becomes acceptable. If it was already
   * acceptable in the beginning (i.e., no halving were done), then
   * maybe it was necessary to enlarge it; then it is iteratively
   * doubled while it remains acceptable. The last acceptable value
   * found is taken, provided that it is between MIN_STEP and MAX_STEP
   * and does not bring t over 1.0.
   *
   * Caveat: this algorithm is not perfect, since it can happen that a
   * step is considered acceptable even when the curve is not linear at
   * all in the interval [t, t+step] (but its mid point coincides "by
   * chance" with the midpoint according to the parametrization). This
   * kind of glitches can be eliminated with proper first derivative
   * estimates; however, given the improbability of such configurations,
   * the mitigation offered by MIN_STEP and the small computational
   * power available on Arduino, I think it is not wise to implement it.
